# Blockchain-based-National-Scholarship-Portal
The National Scholarship Portal (NSP) faces challenges like non-automated systems, complex processes, physical verifications, fraud, delays, and data security. This research proposes a blockchain-based solution to create a tamper-proof, streamlined, and secure system, enhancing trust and accountability in scholarship management.
