# Blockchain-based-National-Scholarship-Portal
The National Scholarship Portal (NSP) faces challenges like non-automated systems, complex processes, physical verifications, fraud, delays, and data security. This research proposes a blockchain-based solution to create a tamper-proof, streamlined, and secure system, enhancing trust and accountability in scholarship management.

This project started in 2016-17 as a proposal. The paper and presentation are available in the [following link](https://github.com/LifnaJos/Blockchain-based-National-Scholarship-Portal/edit/Intelligent-Scholarship-Disbursement-Module-for-National-Scholarship-Portal-(NSP)-(2016-17))
