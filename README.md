# Blockchain-based-National-Scholarship-Portal
The National Scholarship Portal (NSP) faces challenges like non-automated systems, complex processes, physical verifications, fraud, delays, and data security. This research proposes a blockchain-based solution to create a tamper-proof, streamlined, and secure system, enhancing trust and accountability in scholarship management.

### Paper Relevance : 
* Total 135 Lakh applications were received and approx. 1825 Crores of funds has been dispersed in the year 2022-23.

### Blockchain Benefits :
ðŸ“Œ Reduces time delay in Verification & Fund Transfer from 2 - 3 months to 2 weeks.

ðŸ“Œ Fool-Proof verification via Third Party Integration 

ðŸ“Œ Issual of 80G certificate via IT Department 

ðŸ“Œ Track the student progress throughout the studies

ðŸ“Œ Full tuition fee coverage via eligibility-based scholarships.
